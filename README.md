# Telegram Bot using Agentic RAG

Cos I tried to cobble together a serverless TG bot running thru Eliza but seriously it is so messy that nothing really works. (Also it really is just wrapping alot around things and copy-pasta from python side of stuff)

So I need a more simple modular stack. No choice, I just have to stitch it up from ground again.
